Original Draft: 
Using AI in economics research felt like double-sided sword. It enables faster and machine learning but at the same time in a way eliminates one's critical thinking skills.

First Draft Without AI:

The paper touched on lots of things and highlighted a wide range of benefits from using AI in economic research. As you write, you can use it to synthesize text from bullet points and edit paragraphs for improvements in grammar, style, and clarity, ensuring the overall writing maintains a proficient level. I think one thing i noticed that was different than other writings i have read was the rating system the writer proposed. Essentially, there are 3 categories, ○ (empty circle) is experimental capabilities requiring significant oversight; ◐ (half-full) means it is useful but needs careful oversight; then ● (full circle) means it is highly useful and reliable. There are many different LLMs in the market such as Claude, Chatgpt, Deepseek, Grok etc. Most writing and data manipulation tasks rate as highly useful (●), while mathematical derivations remain experimental (○).

Second Draft with Claude AI:

The paper by Anton Korinek touched on numerous topics and highlighted a wide range of benefits from using AI in economic research. As you write, you can use it to synthesize text from bullet points and edit paragraphs for improvements in grammar, style, and clarity, ensuring the overall writing maintains a proficient level. The author specifically notes that LLMs can help with tasks like generating catchy titles, creating tweets to promote papers, and even evaluating text for its stylistic shortcomings.

One thing I noticed that was different than other writings I have read was the practical rating system the writer proposed. Essentially, there are three categories: ○ (empty circle) for experimental capabilities requiring significant oversight; ◐ (half-full) for useful capabilities that need careful oversight; and ● (full circle) for highly useful and reliable features.

There are many different LLMs in the market such as Claude 2 (which notably has a 100,000 token context window for processing entire papers), ChatGPT with GPT-4, and open-source options like Meta's LlaMA 2. The paper provides specific examples using these tools, demonstrating that most writing and data manipulation tasks rate as highly useful (●), while mathematical derivations remain experimental (○). Interestingly, the author found that coding assistance falls somewhere in the middle (◐), citing evidence that GitHub Copilot increased programmer productivity by 56% despite still requiring human oversight.

Third Draft with Claude AI:

Anton Korinek's paper provides a systematic examination of generative AI's impact on economic research, though his optimism warrants scrutiny. While he demonstrates that LLMs can synthesize text from bullet points and edit for grammar, style, and clarity, his own experiments reveal concerning limitations. For instance, when he asked GPT-4 to simulate the Solow growth model, the system correctly generated the code but then hallucinated its interpretation, incorrectly claiming capital approached a steady state despite assuming positive population growth—a basic economic impossibility.
The paper's three-tier rating system (○ for experimental, ◐ for useful but requiring oversight, ● for highly reliable) provides valuable nuance often missing in AI discussions. However, even "highly useful" applications have caveats. When Korinek asked GPT-3.5 about the second welfare theorem, it confidently returned the definition of the first theorem instead, a fundamental error that could mislead students.

The empirical evidence presents a mixed picture. While Peng et al. (2023) found GitHub Copilot increased programmer productivity by 56%, and Noy and Zhang (2023) showed ChatGPT made writers 40% faster, Korinek's own testing revealed persistent issues. Mathematical derivations remain particularly problematic: when deriving CES demand functions, GPT-4 repeatedly made algebraic errors, forgetting terms even after corrections. His attempts to have Claude 2 assess Federal Reserve statements showed the model could identify general hawkish tones but missed subtle policy shifts that human experts readily caught.
Perhaps most tellingly, Korinek frames his long-term predictions as "speculative," acknowledging that while LLMs excel at micro-tasks, their path to replacing economic researchers remains uncertain. His comparison to chess—where computers evolved from weak competitors to complete dominance—may overlook economics' fundamentally different nature: understanding human behavior requires judgment that current AI, despite processing massive datasets, still lacks

Fourth Draft with Claude AI
After reading Korinek's paper, I found myself both excited and skeptical about AI's role in economic research. The paper does an excellent job cataloging what these tools can actually do right now, not just what they might do someday. What struck me most was how honest Korinek was about the failures. When he tried getting GPT-4 to simulate basic economic models, it would write perfect code but then completely misinterpret the results. In one case, it claimed capital was approaching steady state when the model clearly showed exponential growth. That's not a small mistake; any first-year grad student would catch that.

The productivity gains are real though. Researchers using GitHub Copilot coded 56% faster, and writers with ChatGPT improved their speed by 40%. For my own BNPL research, these tools have been invaluable for specific tasks. I've used Claude to quickly extract payment patterns from hundreds of consumer complaint narratives, something that would have taken weeks to code manually. GPT-4 helps me reformat messy transaction data from different BNPL providers into consistent formats for analysis. When writing up findings about consumer behavior patterns, I'll often dump my rough notes into ChatGPT to get a cleaner first draft, though I always have to fix its tendency to overstate conclusions.

But here's what Korinek's paper really gets right: these tools are best for what he calls "micro-tasks." Need to convert a bibliography from APA to Chicago style? Perfect. Want to brainstorm factors affecting BNPL adoption rates? Helpful starting point. Trying to build a theoretical model of BNPL market equilibrium with information asymmetries? You're basically on your own. The math capabilities just aren't there yet, and even when the AI gets the algebra right, it often misses the economic intuition entirely.

For BNPL research specifically, I see AI as a research assistant, not a collaborator. It can help me process qualitative data about consumer experiences, generate initial hypotheses about market dynamics, and clean up my writing. But understanding why consumers choose BNPL over credit cards, or predicting how regulatory changes will affect market structure? That still requires human judgment about human behavior, something Korinek acknowledges might be the last frontier for AI in economics.
