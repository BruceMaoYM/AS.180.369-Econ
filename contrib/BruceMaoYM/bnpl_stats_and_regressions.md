## **8. Policy Implications & Regulatory Concerns**

### **Credit Reporting Gap**
- **Hidden Debt Problem**: $33.8B in BNPL obligations not visible to other lenders
- **Cross-Firm Blind Spots**: 33% of borrowers use multiple providers simultaneously
- **Underwriting Challenges**: Other creditors can't see BNPL obligations when making lending decisions
- **Regulatory Arbitrage**: BNPL operates outside traditional credit reporting framework

### **Consumer Protection Issues**
- **Heavy Users**: 20% of borrowers, median 23 loans/year, 2.6 active loans daily
- **Subprime Concentration**: 61% of originations to subprime/deep subprime borrowers
- **Age Vulnerability**: 18-24 year olds most at risk, BNPL represents 28% of debt when borrowing
- **Financial Stress Indicators**: BNPL users hold $871-$5,734 MORE in other unsecured debt

### **Market Structure Concerns**
- **Counteroffers**: 8 p.p. increase in approval rates (2020 vs. 2022)
- **High Approval Rates**: 78% for subprime/deep subprime borrowers
- **Seasonal Risk**: Holiday season drives simultaneous loan stacking
- **Automatic Repayment**: Required by most BNPL firms (explains low 2% default rate)
