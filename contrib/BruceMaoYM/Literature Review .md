First Draft without AI:
This paper shows that when people get access to buy now pay later credit, they end up spending more overall. They less likely to use traditional credit cards and save less so ended up spending more in retail shopping and incur overdraft fees

Second Draft with Cursor:

This paper shows that when people get access to buy now pay later credit, they end up spending more overall. BNPL users are less likely to use traditional credit cards and save less money, which leads them to spend more on retail shopping and incur more overdraft fees compared to non-users.

Third Draft with Cursor:

This study uses transaction-level data from 10 million consumers to examine buy now, pay later (BNPL) credit in the US market. The authors find that BNPL users are less likely to use traditional credit cards and save less, and are more likely to incur overdraft fees compared to non-users. Using a causal identification strategy that exploits variation in retailer BNPL adoption timing, the paper shows that BNPL access increases total spending by approximately $60-130 per week, with spending shifts concentrated in retail categories. BNPL also facilitates consumption smoothing by weakening the correlation between spending and income, especially for lower-income users.

Fourth Draft with Cursor:

This study uses transaction-level data from 10 million consumers to examine buy now, pay later (BNPL) credit in the US market. The authors find that BNPL users are less likely to use traditional credit cards and save less, and are more likely to incur overdraft fees compared to non-users. Using a causal identification strategy that exploits variation in retailer BNPL adoption timing, the paper shows that BNPL access increases total spending by approximately $60-130 per week, with these effects concentrated in retail spending. BNPL also facilitates consumption smoothing by decoupling spending from income fluctuations, particularly for lower-income users. However, the spending increases are too large to be explained by standard lifecycle models with reasonable discount rates. The authors argue these results are consistent with a "liquidity flypaper effect," where BNPL liquidity "sticks" to retail categories and encourages additional same-category purchases. Notably, these effects persist even for consumers who are not liquidity-constrained, such as those with savings or credit cards, suggesting mechanisms beyond simple intertemporal substitution.

This study examines the effects of buy now, pay later (BNPL) credit using transaction-level data from 10 million US consumers. The authors find that BNPL users are less likely to use traditional credit cards and save less, and are more likely to incur overdraft fees compared to non-users.

The study also demonstrates that BNPL facilitates consumption smoothing by weakening the correlation between spending and income, particularly for lower-income users.

However, the magnitude of spending increases cannot be explained by standard lifecycle models with reasonable discount rates. The authors argue these results are consistent with a "liquidity flypaper effect," where BNPL liquidity "sticks" to retail categories and encourages additional purchases in the same category. Notably, these effects persist even for consumers who are not liquidity-constrained, such as those with savings or credit cards, suggesting mechanisms beyond simple intertemporal substitution.

 can personally relate to this paper's findings, ironically. As someone who has used PayPal's "Pay in 4" feature, I noticed that having this flexible payment option made me feel like I had more available liquidity. When shopping for clothes, I would justify additional purchases thinking, "I can spread this out over four payments." This created a psychological separation between the full cost and my immediate budget. Even though I technically had the liquidity to pay upfront, the deferred payment structure made me less price-sensitive and led to purchases I might not have made otherwise. My patterns shifted towards more discretionary retail spending, consistent with the study's findings of the flypaper effect where liquidity "sticks" to where it's offered.
