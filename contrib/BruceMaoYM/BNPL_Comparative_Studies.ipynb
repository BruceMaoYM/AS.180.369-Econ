    "## The Australian BNPL Experience (Powell et al., 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Australian study surveyed 360 BNPL users, evenly split between those under and over 25 years old, with 60% female and 40% male participants. Using online surveys with Likert scales and structural equation modeling for analysis, the researchers uncovered deeply concerning patterns about consumer engagement with BNPL services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most striking finding relates to how users interact with terms and conditions. Nearly half of respondents (47%) spent less than five minutes reading these crucial documents. The time investment correlated directly with comprehension levels: those who claimed to *completely* understand averaged 15 minutes of reading, while those admitting to *not at all* understanding spent merely 2 minutes."

    "### **Research Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the literature review (Australian & Italian studies showing BNPL attracts vulnerable consumers), we test:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: BNPL firms sacrifice profitability for growth, making their business model more vulnerable to credit losses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight from literature**: BNPL relies on merchant fees + late fees, while traditional lenders have interest income to offset defaults. This makes BNPL more fragile.\n",

    "\n",
    "## REGRESSION MODEL: Profitability Panel Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What This Model Tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do BNPL firms grow GMV faster but maintain lower profitability?\n",
    "- Are BNPL firms more sensitive to credit losses (because they lack interest income)?\n",
    "- Does the BNPL business model operate differently than traditional fintech lending?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What We're Arguing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If β₃ < 0 and β₄ < 0, this shows BNPL firms have:\n",
    "1. Lower profitability after controlling for growth and losses\n",
    "2. Stronger negative response to credit losses\n",
    "3. A structurally weaker business model\n",
    "\n",
    "This supports the literature's finding that BNPL is a \"gateway to debt\" that harms vulnerable consumers.\n",
