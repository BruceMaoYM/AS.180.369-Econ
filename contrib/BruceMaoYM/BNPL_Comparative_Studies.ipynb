    "The Australian study surveyed 360 BNPL users, evenly split between those under and over 25 years old, with 60% female and 40% male participants. Using online surveys with Likert scales and structural equation modeling for analysis, the researchers uncovered deeply concerning patterns about consumer engagement with BNPL services.\n",

    "The most striking finding relates to how users interact with terms and conditions. Nearly half of respondents (47%) spent less than five minutes reading these crucial documents. The time investment correlated directly with comprehension levels: those who claimed to *completely* understand averaged 15 minutes of reading, while those admitting to *not at all* understanding spent merely 2 minutes."

    "Based on the literature review (Australian & Italian studies showing BNPL attracts vulnerable consumers), we test:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: BNPL firms sacrifice profitability for growth, making their business model more vulnerable to credit losses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight from literature**: BNPL relies on merchant fees + late fees, while traditional lenders have interest income to offset defaults. This makes BNPL more fragile.\n",

    "### **What This Model Tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do BNPL firms grow GMV faster but maintain lower profitability?\n",
    "- Are BNPL firms more sensitive to credit losses (because they lack interest income)?\n",
    "- Does the BNPL business model operate differently than traditional fintech lending?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What We're Arguing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If β₃ < 0 and β₄ < 0, this shows BNPL firms have:\n",
    "1. Lower profitability after controlling for growth and losses\n",
    "2. Stronger negative response to credit losses\n",
    "3. A structurally weaker business model\n",

    "## **Expected Results & Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Finding #1: β₃ < 0** \n",
    "**What this means:** BNPL firms have lower profitability than traditional fintech firms, even after controlling for credit losses and growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If β₃ = -1.5, this indicates BNPL firms have 1.5 percentage points lower ROA on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Supports our hypothesis that BNPL business model prioritizes growth over profitability\n",
    "- Consistent with CFPB findings showing declining unit margins (1.27% → 1.01% from 2020-2021)\n",
    "- Suggests BNPL firms are less efficient at converting revenue to profit\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it indicates:** BNPL firms operate on thin margins, making them less resilient to economic downturns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Finding #2: β₄ < 0** (INTERACTION TERM)\n",
    "**What this means:** BNPL firms experience MORE severe impact from credit losses than traditional fintech firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "- If β₁ = -0.20 and β₄ = -0.25:\n",
    "  - Traditional fintech firm: Loss effect = -0.20 (lose 0.20% ROA per 1% charge-off rate)\n",
    "  - BNPL firm: Loss effect = β₁ + β₄ = -0.20 + (-0.25) = **-0.45** (lose 0.45% ROA per 1% charge-off rate)\n",
    "  - **BNPL firms suffer MORE than 2x the impact**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this happens:**\n",
    "- Traditional lenders earn interest income even on risky loans → cushions against defaults\n",
    "- BNPL earns merchant fees upfront → no ongoing revenue to offset losses\n",
    "- When defaults spike, BNPL has **no buffer** from interest income\n",
    "- This is the \"fragility\" at the core of our hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it indicates:**\n",
    "- BNPL business model is more vulnerable to credit cycle downturns\n",
    "- Supports our hypothesis that BNPL harms consumers by targeting financially vulnerable borrowers who default more often\n",
    "- Explains why we saw charge-off rates increase from 1.83% (2020) → 2.39% (2021) as macro conditions deteriorated\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What if we find β₄ = 0?**\n",
    "- Would indicate BNPL and traditional firms respond to losses similarly\n",
    "- Would suggest BNPL business model isn't more fragile\n",
    "- **Would weaken our hypothesis** (but still support it if β₃ < 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What if we find β₄ > 0?**\n",
    "- Would indicate BNPL firms handle losses BETTER than traditional firms\n",
    "- Would contradict our hypothesis\n",
    "- Would suggest BNPL model is actually more resilient (unlikely given CFPB data)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-World Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 1: Economic boom (low defaults)**\n",
    "- Traditional firms: Modest profitability from interest income\n",
    "- BNPL firms: Higher profitability from merchant fees (fewer losses to offset)\n",
    "- **β₃ < 0 still holds**: BNPL may be less profitable even in good times\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Economic recession (high defaults)** ← **Key Scenario**\n",
    "- Traditional firms: Interest income helps absorb losses\n",
    "- BNPL firms: No interest cushion → profitability collapses\n",
    "- **β₄ < 0 becomes critical**: Shows BNPL firms punished severely\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** BNPL business model works well in good times but **fails catastrophically in bad times**, exactly as we hypothesize.\n",
