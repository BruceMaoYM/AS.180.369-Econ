\f0\fs24 \cf0 I would like to focus my paper on the effects of environmental regulations on affordable housing supply. In recent years, there has been a big debate over whether environmental regulations such as those in California are limiting affordable housing, and one of said laws was recently repealed. I would like to explore this topic in my paper. \
\
My initial hypothesis is that overly strict environmental regulations have led to a decreased housing supply and therefore led to higher housing prices in California and other states. I am also wondering if I could somehow study the trade-offs between these policies environmental benefits and housing-supply downsides. }
