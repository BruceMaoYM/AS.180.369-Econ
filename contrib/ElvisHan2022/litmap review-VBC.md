# Literature Review Strategy

## 1. Organizing by Policy Type
To structure my review, I divided the search into two streams of performance-linked value-based care policies:
- **Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP):** a penalty-based policy targeting 30-day readmissions.
- **Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (HVBP):** a redistribution policy tying payments to multiple quality domains.

This separation ensured that I could both track policy-specific outcomes and compare how different incentive designs shaped provider behavior.

## 2. Literature Searches (via Litmaps)
I conducted two separate Litmaps searches:

- **Search 1 (HRRP):**  
  Keywords: *“Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program,” “Medicare penalties,” “observation stays”*  
  Focus: Captured both main policy outcomes and the substitution debate.  
  Inclusion: Papers measuring readmission rates, mortality, out-of-pocket costs, or post-acute access with causal/econometric methods.  
  Exclusion: Descriptive-only studies with no clear identification strategy.

- **Search 2 (HVBP):**  
  Keywords: *“Hospital Value-Based Purchasing,” “Medicare performance-based payments,” “equity in hospital incentives”*  
  Focus: Brought in evaluations of mortality, patient safety, HCAHPS, and spending efficiency.  
  Inclusion: Empirical studies using hospital-level or claims data.  
  Exclusion: Purely theoretical commentary or papers with no outcome measurement.

## 3. Agreements, Disagreements, and Key Findings
- **HRRP:**  
  - **Agreement:** Inpatient readmissions declined modestly.  
  - **Disagreement:** Whether declines reflected true care improvements versus substitution into observation and ED visits.  
  - **Key theme:** Unintended consequences such as higher out-of-pocket costs, restricted SNF access, and possible mortality increases in heart failure.

- **HVBP:**  
  - **Agreement:** Limited average improvements in quality measures.  
  - **Disagreement:** Whether this reflected weak incentives or gains concentrated in already high-performing hospitals.  
  - **Key theme:** Concerns about equity, with safety-net and rural hospitals disadvantaged under redistribution rules.

## 4. Most Important Papers Identified
- **HRRP:**  
  - *JAMA Cardiology* evaluation linking HRRP to increased heart failure mortality.  
  - *Health Affairs* study documenting the surge in observation stays after HRRP rollout.  
  *Significance:* Together, these capture both intended effects (reduced readmissions) and unintended harms (increased mortality, patient burden).

- **HVBP:**  
  - *NEJM* article showing little change in mortality or patient safety under HVBP.  
  - *Health Services Research* study documenting redistributive effects disadvantaging high social-risk hospitals.  
  *Significance:* These frame the central debate of effectiveness versus fairness.

## 5. Research Opportunity Framed
- **HRRP:** The unresolved question is not simply whether readmissions declined, but whether the policy imposed financial and health damages on patients through substitution.  
- **HVBP:** The key gap is whether the program produced genuine quality improvements or primarily redistributed dollars toward advantaged hospitals.  

This framing highlights opportunities for an econometric study that quantifies both the **substitution damages under HRRP** and the **redistributive fairness of HVBP**.
