Redlining, formalized through the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps of the 1930s, institutionalized racial and ethnic segregation in U.S. cities by denying mortgage access to neighborhoods labeled “hazardous,” which were often home to Black, immigrant, and Jewish residents. While extensive research has documented redlining’s enduring effects on wealth, housing, and health, its implications for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education remain understudied. This paper investigates whether the legacy of redlining continues to shape modern disparities in STEM education access. Using a boundary discontinuity design modeled after Aaronson, Hartley, and Mazumder (2021, 2022), I compare schools located just inside and outside historical HOLC map boundaries to isolate the long-run effects of redlining from confounding neighborhood characteristics. I integrate digitized HOLC map data with contemporary datasets from the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD), and the American Community Survey (ACS) to examine advanced STEM course offerings, per-pupil funding, and STEM degree attainment. Preliminary evidence suggests that schools in historically redlined areas continue to have lower access to advanced STEM coursework and reduced STEM degree attainment, even after controlling for income and funding. These findings highlight how structural racism in housing policy continues to constrain STEM opportunity and perpetuate educational inequality today.
